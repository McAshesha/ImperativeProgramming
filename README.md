# 🖥️ Imperative Programming Assignments 🧑‍💻

Hello! I’m Kovalev V. from group 24940 IIR, and this repository contains my solutions to various **imperative programming** tasks. Buckle up and enjoy some good old-fashioned C programming!

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repo is divided into main sections for your convenience:

- `1_sem/` – All tasks for the 1st semester

### 🗂️ Detailed Structure:
```bash
.
├── 1_sem/
│   ├── homeworks/
│   │   ├── 1_pack/
│   │   │   ├── 1_sumn/
│   │   │   │   ├── solution.c  # Solution to Task 1
│   │   │   │   └── task.pdf    # Task description
│   │   │   ├── ...             # Additional tasks
│   │   ├── .../ # Additional packs
│   └── lectures/

├── 2_sem/

├── README.md   # This README file
├── c_book.pdf  # C Programming Book for Reference
├── c_book_algorithms.pdf  # C Algorithms Book for Reference
└── main.c          # Main C file for testing or reference
```

## 🛠️ How to Use

Clone this repo using your favorite terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/McAshesha/ImperativeProgramming.git
```
Navigate to the specific semester and pack you're interested in.

Compile the C files using your favorite compiler:
```bash
gcc solution.c -o task
./task
```

## 🤖 What’s Inside?

Each folder within the `1_pack` and `2_pack` directories is organized by tasks (e.g., `1_sumn`, `2_boxarea`). Each `solution.c` file contains my personal approach to solving the respective problems. If anything breaks, it's totally not a bug, it’s just a feature! 😉

## 📘 Additional Resources

- **C Programming Book**: Check out `c_book.pdf` in the root of the repository for an in-depth guide to C programming.
- **C Algorithms Book**: Refer to `c_book_algorithms.pdf` for algorithms in C.
- **C Programming Tutorial**: Visit [Metanit C Tutorial](https://metanit.com/c/tutorial/) for more tutorials and explanations.
- **Imperative Programming Navigator**: Visit [Navigator](https://sites.google.com/g.nsu.ru/m-filippov/) for more resources and information.

## 💡 Notes:

Feel free to use these solutions as a reference, but don’t copy them directly! (The compiler gods will know 😈). If you spot a mistake, feel free to open an issue! After all, programming is all about debugging.
Let the code be with you! 👨‍💻✨
