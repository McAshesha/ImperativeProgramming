# 🖥️ Imperative Programming Assignments 🧑‍💻

Hello! I’m Ковалёв В. Я. from group 24940 ИИР, and this repository contains my solutions to various **imperative programming** tasks. Buckle up and enjoy some good old-fashioned C programming!

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repo is divided into two main parts for your convenience:

- `1_sem/` – All tasks for the 1st semester
- `2_sem/` – All tasks for the 2nd semester

Within each semester, you'll find **packs** of tasks (because who doesn't love organizing, right?). Each **pack** (e.g., `1_pack/`, `2_pack/`, etc.) contains the solution files for specific tasks.

### 🗂️ Example Structure:
```bash
.
├── 1_sem/
│   ├── 1_pack/
│   │   ├── solution.c  # Solution to Task 1
│   │   ├── solution.c  # Solution to Task 2
│   │   └── -.c  # ...
│   └── 2_pack/
│       ├── solution.c
│       ├── solution.c
│       └── -.c
├── 2_sem/
│   ├── 1_pack/
│   ├── 2_pack/
│   └── -_pack/ # ...
└── README.md   # This README file
```
## 🛠️ How to Use
Clone this repo using your favorite terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/McAshesha/ImperativeProgramming.git
```
Navigate to the specific semester and pack you're interested in.
Compile the C files using your favorite compiler:
```bash
gcc solution.c -o task1
./task1
```
## 🤖 What’s Inside?
Each file is named by task number (1.c, 2.c, etc.), and contains my personal magic touch for solving the respective problems. If anything breaks, it's totally not a bug, it’s just a feature! 😉

## 💡 Notes:
Feel free to use these solutions as a reference, but don't copy them directly! (The compiler gods will know 😈)
If you spot a mistake, feel free to open an issue! After all, programming is all about debugging.
Let the code be with you! 👨‍💻✨
